# Art 336 Exercise Archive Page
Everyone will need to create a subdomain called **art336**.yourdomain.com to upload all your exercises and upload the index.html page in this repository.

## Name.com & Class Hosting
If you are using my hosting you can find video tutorials on how to do this at the [class Vimeo page](https://vimeo.com/channels/art336/).

<del>I havenâ€™t made tutorials for adding a subdomain to Bluehost. You can either look at their tutorials (they have tons) or you can setup a time with me to help you setup your subdomain.</del>

## Bluehost
